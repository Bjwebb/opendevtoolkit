<p>The Open Development Toolkit is a project from <a href="http://devinit.org//">Development Initiatives</a> and the <a href=
    "http://okfn.org">Open Knowledge Foundation</a> starting in January 2014. The Toolkit will act as a hub around open development, bringing together tools and training materials to maximise the use of open data that could be used to inform international development.


<p>We'll be seeking input from experts in the open development sector very soon - which tools do you already use to make sense of open data, and what features would you like to see in them? There will also be a focus throughout the project on the needs of citizens in aid-receiving countries - what would you like to know about aid flows into your country, and how would you like to best access them?
