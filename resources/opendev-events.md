There's a lot going on within the Open Development community, and in the spirit of avoiding duplication and promoting collaboration, we'd love to encourage sharing when workshops are taking place. Events from the [Open Development guide on Lanyrd](http://lanyrd.com/guides/open-development/) are embedded below; we're aware that lots of more informal events and workshops don't make it to Lanyrd though, so if you'd like to let the community know about upcoming events you're organising, drop Zara a line on [zara.rahman[at]okfn.org](mailto:zara.rahman@okfn.org), or simply [submit a pull request](https://github.com/zararah/opendevtoolkit/blob/gh-pages/resources/opendev-events.md) and add it to the page yourself. 

If you have other suggestions on how things could be best organised on this page, let us know!
