Today, February 11th, is [The Day We Fight Back](https://thedaywefightback.org/) against mass surveillance. It's been framed by its organisers as a protest against NSA surveillance - so, you might wonder, what does that have to do with Open Development data? 

A lot, actually. There have been multiple occasions when mass surveillance and data collection have played huge roles in facilitating humanitarian crises such as genocides. In addition, as has been covered comprehensively by Privacy International's report, "Aiding Privacy", aid organisations are now some of the biggest data collectors among the world's most vulnerable communities; what could happen if that data got into the wrong hands? 

The debate around the ethics of data collection in international development is ongoing with groups such as the engine room, Privacy International, Aspiration Tech, the Open Knowledge Foundation, and researchers around the world; see the Responsible Data Forum series of events for more information. 

To make really clear the link between surveillance and mass human rights' abuses, and to highlight some of humanity's worst examples of what can happen with mass surveillance, lack of freedom of expression, and abuse of data, here are a couple of examples. 

<h2>The Rwandan genocide</h2> 

During the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, ID cards identifying people by their so-called "ethnic group" served, for some, as an effective death sentence. Including "ethnic group identities" on ID cards introduced in 1993 by the Belgian colonial government not only brought the very idea of rigid racial group identities to the fore, but it also ["facilitated the identification of victims"](http://www.preventgenocide.org/edu/pastgenocides/rwanda/indangamuntu.htm) and meant that the genocide took place in a terrifyingly systematic and organised way.

<h2>Institutionalised discrimination towards asylum seekers in Bangladesh</h2> 

The introduction of ID cards in Bangladesh could be blocking millions of Rohingya asylum seekers from receiving basic human rights; access to education, to food, and basic public services. There are over 200,000 Rohingya asylum seekers who are not eligible for identification cards given to recognised Bengali nationals. The cards also make carrying out 'unofficial' work increasingly difficult for unregistered Rohingyas, thus diminishing their already meagre opportunities to earn money.

<h2>Data-gathering in the Netherlands prior to the Holocaust</h2> 

Prior to Nazi occupation, in the Netherlands, a ["comprehensive population registration system for administrative and statistical purposes"](https://pantherfile.uwm.edu/margo/public/publications/darkside4897395.pdf) had already been completed. During Nazi occupation, this structure, aimed at following people "from cradle to grave" (see previous reference), was then adapted to create special registration systems covering Jewish and Roma populations within the Netherlands, and ["played an important role in the[ir] apprehension"](https://pantherfile.uwm.edu/margo/public/publications/darkside4897395.pdf). Evidence of how "effective" this method was can perhaps be seen in the statistics - at a terrible 73%, Dutch Jews had the highest death rate among all other occupied western European countries. As comparison, the death rate among the Jewish population in Belgium was 40% and in France, 25%.

<h2>IBM and the Holocaust</h2>

<blockquote>""The government of our FÃ¼hrer and Reichschancellor Adolf Hitler is statistics-friendly," wrote Zahn in Allgemeines Statistisches Archiv (ASA), the official journal of the German Statistical Society" ([Source: Gizmodo, "How IBM Technology Jump Started the Holocaust"](http://gizmodo.com/5812025/how-ibm-technology-jump-started-the-holocaust))</blockquote>

Systems to identify Jews on a large scale played a key role in the Holocaust, and the development of punch card technology facilited automation - and thus speed - of collection of this data. Statistical publications released from Germany throughout this period, with titles such as "Development of German Population Statistics through Genetic-Biological Stock-Taking" and "The Position of Statistics in the New Reich" give perhaps an idea of the importance given to statistics as a facilitating factor to the Holocaust.

<h2>Internment of Japanese-Americans in World War II</h2>

After decades of denial, it was revealed just a few years ago that during World War II, the U.S. Census Bureau provided the U.S. Secret Service with data from the 1940 census to identify people of Japanese ancestry, ["to assist in the roundup of Japanese-Americans for imprisonment in internment camps in California and six other states during the war."](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/confirmed-the-us-census-b/) Researchers who revealed this say that the speed with which the data was released, just seven days after it was requested, lead them to ["believe this was a well-established path"](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/confirmed-the-us-census-b/).
