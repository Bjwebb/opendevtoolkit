What is the currency of change? What can coders (consumers) do with IATI data? How can suppliers deliver the data sets? Last week I had the honour of participating in the <a href="http://www.open-dev-ouvert.ca/">Open Data for Development Codeathon</a> and the <a href="http://www.aidtransparency.net/">International Aid Transparency Initiative</a> Technical Advisory Group meetings. IATI's goal is to make information about aid spending easier to access, use, and understand. It was great that these events were back-to-back to push a big picture view.  
 
My big takeaways included similar themes that I have learned on my open source journey:

<blockquote>You can talk about open data [insert tech or OS project] all you want, but if you don't have an interactive community (including mentorship programmes), an education strategy, engagement/feedback loops plan, translation/localization plan and a process for people to learn how to contribute, then you build a double-edged barrier: <strong>barrier to entry and barrier for impact/contributor outputs.</strong> </blockquote>

<h4>About the Open Data in Development Codeathon</h4>

At the Codathon close, Mark Surman, Executive Director of <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/foundation/">Mozilla Foundation</a>, gave us a call to action to make the web. Well, in order to create a world of data makers, I think we should run aid and development processes through this mindset. What is the <strong>currency of change? </strong> I hear many people talking about theory of change and impact, but I'd like to add <em>'currency'</em>. This is not only about money, this is about using the best brainpower and best energy sources to solve real world problems in smart ways. I think if we heed Mark's call to action with a <strong>"yes, and",</strong> then we can rethink how we approach complex change. Every single industry is suffering from the same issue: how to deal with the influx of supply and demand in information. We need to change how we approach the problem. Combined events like these give a window into tackling problems in a new format. It is not about the next greatest app, but more about asking: <em>how can we learn from the Webmakers</em> and build with each other in our respective fields and networks?  

<h4>Ease of Delivery</h4>
 
The IATI community / network is very passionate about moving the ball forward on releasing data. During the sessions, it was clear that the attendees see some gaps and are already working to fill them.  The new IATI website is set up to grow with a Community component. The feedback from each of the sessions was distilled by the IATI - TAG and Civil Society Guidance groups to share with the IATI Secretariat.  

In the Open Data in Development, Impact of Open Data in Developing Countries, and CSO Guidance sessions, we discussed some key items about sharing, learning, and using IATI data. Farai Matsika, with <a href="http://www.aidsalliance.org/">International HIV/Aids Alliance</a>, was particularly poignant reminding us of IATI's CSO purpose - <strong>we need to share data with those we serve.  </strong>

One of the biggest themes was data ethics. As we rush to ask NGOs and CSOs to release data, what are some of the data pitfalls? Anahi Ayala Iaccuci of <a href="http://www.internews.org/">Internews</a> and Linda Raftree of <a href="http://www.planusa.org/"> Plan International USA</a> both reminded participants that data needs to be anonymized to protect those at risk. Ms. Iaccuci asked that we consider the complex nature of sharing both sides of the open data story - successes and failures.  As well, she advised: <em>don't create trust, but think about who people are trusting.</em> Turning this model around is key to rethinking assumptions. I would add to her point: <strong>trust and sharing are currency and will add to the success measures of IATI.</strong> If people don't trust the IATI data, they won't share and use it. 

Anne Crowe of <a href="https://www.privacyinternational.org/">Privacy International</a> frequently asked attendees to consider the ramifications of opening data. It is clear that the IATI TAG does not curate the data that NGOS and CSOs share. Thus it falls on each of these organizations to learn how to be data makers in order to contribute data to IATI. Perhaps organizations need a lead educator and curator to ensure the future success of the IATI process, including quality data. 

I think that <a href="http://schoolofdata.org/">School of Data</a> and the <a href="http://okfn.org/pod/">Partnership for Open Data</a> have a huge part to play with IATI. My colleague Zara Rahman is collecting user feedback for the <a href="http://opendevtoolkit.net/">Open Development Toolkit</a>, and Katelyn Rogers is leading the <a href="https://lists.okfn.org/mailman/listinfo/open-development">Open Development mailing list</a>. We collectively want to help people become data makers and consumers to effectively achieve their development goals using open data. This also means also tackling the ongoing questions about data quality and data ethics.
