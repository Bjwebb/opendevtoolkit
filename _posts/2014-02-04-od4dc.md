The event centred around a 36 hour "codathon" around various technical challenges, as well as a series of [panel discussions](http://www.open-dev-ouvert.ca/programme/).  

Anahi Ayala's Storify roundups give a great overall impression of the two days ([Day 1](http://storify.com/anahi_ayala/open-data-for-development-challange-day-1) and [Day 2](http://storify.com/anahi_ayala/open-data-for-development-day-2)); so rather than doing another round up here, we thought we'd look at some of the tools and resources which came up during the two days. 

In terms of resources, a good place to begin is with the Challenge Hackpads, all of which are linked from the [appropriate section in the schedule](http://www.open-dev-ouvert.ca/challenges/). In the 'background information' in each pad, there's a good selection of resources of information on the topic challenge; for example, [this list of Country Aid Management Systems](https://devchallenge.hackpad.com/Challenge-O1-Geocoded-Aid-Data-cn3HsGuKqxj#:h=Country-Aid-Information-Manage) from the Geocoded Aid Data challenge, or this [list of datasets around contracts](https://devchallenge.hackpad.com/Challenge-F1-Open-Contracting-WZSKzabvK3c#:h=Datasets), linked from the [Open Contracting](http://www.open-dev-ouvert.ca/challenges/#contracting) challenge. 

### Tools that were created (at least in part!)

* [Organisation ID-a-tron](http://practicalparticipation.github.io/organisation-id-tool/) -  to help publishers of data to the [International Aid Transparency Initiative](http://iatistandard.org), and related standards, to identify the Organisation Identifier they should use, based on the draft [Organisational Identifier Conventions](http://iatistandard.org/getting-started/organisation-data/organisation-identifiers/).
* [Aid Snapshot](http://spatialdev.github.io/aid-snapshot/) - this is a "proof of concept" tool to provide an easy to digest tool for people wanting to know, at a glance, what is going on with aid in their country. This tool just uses data from Bolivia.

### Initiatives that were mentioned

* [Domestic Reporting Standard Initiative](http://drsinitiative.org/), aimed at helping grantmakers of all types work together more effectively, via establishing a shared standard to report their funding activities. 
* [Information and Networks](http://www.idrc.ca/EN/Programs/Science_and_Innovation/Information_and_Networks/Pages/default.aspx) - from IDRC, "Promoting inclusive development in a networked world"
* Engineers Without Borders' [Failure Reports](http://legacy.ewb.ca/en/whoweare/accountable/failure.html) - a unique initiative collecting, celebrating and learning from failures from around the EWB community. 

### Tools that were used during the challenges

* [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/)- open source and openly licensed map
* [Tabula](http://tabula.nerdpower.org) - to get structured data out of PDFs
* [D3: Data Driven Documents](http://d3js.org/) - helping you 'bring data to life', by manipulating documents based on data 
* [Mozilla AppMaker](https://appmaker.mozillalabs.com/) - a "simple way to create and share personal mobile apps, even if you don't know code."
* [DataMaps](http://datamaps.github.io/) - customizable map visualizations for the web in a single Javscript file using D3.js (see above!)
* [BaseX](http://basex.org/)-A useful tool to download and explore the data on the IATI Registry
* [School of Data's Recommended Tools](http://schoolofdata.org/online-resources/) - including tools for extracting data, cleaning it, analysing, presenting and sharing. 

The discussions that took place during the panels also brought up some interesting points; for example, around the ethics of collecting and using data in international development, especially around vulnerable communities, and the [potential implications](https://www.privacyinternational.org/sites/privacyinternational.org/files/file-downloads/aiding_surveillance.pdf), and designing projects and open data initiatives based around user needs, rather than donor needs. 

In all, there was a great mix of people attending the event - some who had never attended a hackathon before, and others who had rarely had the opportunity to work so closely with people coming from such different perspectives within aid transparency.
